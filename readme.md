## Algorithm

The code uses NSGA2 algorithm to find solution to a single objective problem with many solutions.More about NSGA can be read from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10938979/nsga-2-multi-objetive-genethic-algorithm-anyone-could-give-me-a-simple-explana).

## Code
The code uses python's `platypus` library which have an in built implementation of NSGA algorithm.To run code type: `python main.py`
